##### Im using fontawesome and bootstrap library files with in the project instead you can use CDN Links according to your convenience.

In contact us form i included a form submition and also written the codes(ajax) for handle post operation so you can use options like google sheets as your backend and feel dynamics in our static site :grin:

##### <script>
#####   const scriptURL = 'your post link'
#####   const form = document.forms['gform']
#####   form.addEventListener('submit', e => {
#####     e.preventDefault()
#####   fetch(scriptURL, { method: 'POST', body: new FormData(form)})
#####      .then(response => $('#exampleModalCenter').modal({'show' : true}  ), $('#gform')[0].reset())
#####      .catch(response => $('#exampleModalCenter2').modal({'show' : true}  ) , $('#gform')[0].reset() )
#####   })
##### </script>
